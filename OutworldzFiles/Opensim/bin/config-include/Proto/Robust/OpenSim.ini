;; Opensim.Proto ROBUST VERSION
;; This is the main configuration file for OpenSimulator.
;; If it's named OpenSim.ini then it will be loaded by OpenSimulator.
;; If it's named OpenSim.ini.example then you will need to copy it to
;; OpenSim.ini first (if that file does not already exist)
;;
;; If you are copying, then once you have copied OpenSim.ini.example to
;; OpenSim.ini you will need to pick an architecture in the [Architecture]
;; section at the end of this file.
;; section at the end of this file.
;;
;; The settings in this file are in the form "<key> = <value>".  For example,
;; save_crashes = false in the [Startup] section below.
;;
;; All settings are initially commented out and the default value used, as
;; found in OpenSimDefaults.ini.  To change a setting, first uncomment it by
;; deleting the initial semicolon (;) and then change the value.  This will
;; override the value in OpenSimDefaults.ini
;;
;; If you want to find out what configuration OpenSimulator has finished with
;; once all the configuration files are loaded then type "config show" on the
;; region console command line.
;;
;;
;; NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS REGARDING THE FORMAT OF THIS FILE
;;
;; All leading white space is ignored, but preserved.
;;
;; Double semicolons denote a text comment
;;
;; ;# denotes a configuration directive description
;;    formatted as:
;;    {option} {depends on} {question to ask} {choices} default value
;;    Any text comments following the declaration, up to the next blank line.
;;    will be copied to the generated file (NOTE: generation is not yet
;;   implemented)
;;
;;    A * in the choices list will allow an empty entry.
;;    An empty question will set the default if the dependencies are
;;    satisfied.
;;
;; ;  denotes a commented out option.
;;    Any options added to OpenSim.ini.example should be initially commented
;;    out.

[VivoxVoice]

;
; For this to work you need to obtain an admin account from Vivox
; that allows you to create voice accounts and region channels.

[AutoBackupModule]
;
;
; Configuration Settings
; Global (in OpenSim.ini under [AutoBackupModule] section)
;AutoBackupModuleEnabled: True/False. Default: False. If False, every
;function in the module is as no-op as possible: just return as soon as
;realizing that we're not enabled. Otherwise it will try to get as far as it
;can with auto backup for each region.
; Global (in OpenSim.ini) or Per-Region (in Regions/Regions.ini under theregion's name's section)
;
; IMPORTANT: Settings declared per-region in Regions/Regions.ini override
;settings in OpenSim.ini. Settings in OpenSim.ini, in turn, override
;hard-coded defaults.
;
;AutoBackup: True/False. Default: False. If True activate auto backup functionality.
;This is the only required option for
;enabling auto-backup; the other options have sane defaults. If False, the
;auto-backup module becomes a no-op for the region, and all other
;AutoBackup* settings are ignored.
;
; AutoBackupModuleEnabled: True/False. Default: False. If False, every
;function in the module is as no-op as possible: just return as soon as
;realizing that we're not enabled. Otherwise it will try to get as far as it
;can with auto backup for each region.
;
; AutoBackupInterval: Integer, non-negative value. Default: 720 (12
;hours). The number of minutes between each backup attempt. If a negative or
;zero value is given, it is equivalent to setting AutoBackup = False.
;
; AutoBackupBusyCheck: True/False. Default: True. If True, we will only
;take an auto-backup if a set of conditions are met. These conditions are
;heuristics to try and avoid taking a backup when the sim is busy.
;
; AutoBackupScript: String. Default: not specified (disabled). File path
;to an executable script or binary to run when an automatic backup is taken.
;argv[1] of the executed file/script will be the file name of the generated
;OAR. If the process can't be spawned for some reason (file not found, no
;execute permission, etc), write a warning to the console.
;
; AutoBackupNaming: string. Default: Time.  One of three strings (case
;insensitive):
;
;  "Time": Current timestamp is appended to file name. An existing file
;will never be overwritten.
;
;  "Sequential": A number is appended to the file name. So if
;RegionName_x.oar exists, we'll save to RegionName_{x+1}.oar next. An
;existing file will never be overwritten.
;
;  "Overwrite": Always save to file named "RegionName.oar", even if we
;have to overwrite an existing file.
;
; AutoBackupDir: String. Default: "." (the current directory). A directory
;(absolute or relative) where backups should be saved. If the path is not a
;directory, or insufficient permissions are available, a warning will be
;printed to the console and no backups will be taken.
;
; AutoBackupDilationThreshold: float. Default: 0.5. Lower bound on time
;dilation required for BusyCheck heuristics to pass.  If the time dilation
;is below this value, don't take a backup right now.
;
; AutoBackupAgentThreshold: int. Default: 10. Upper bound on # of agents
;in region required for BusyCheck heuristics to pass.  If the number of
;agents is greater than this value, don't take a backup right now.
;
; AutoBackupKeepFilesForDays: int. Default: 0.
;   1) number of days to keep backups (0 the default value will disable
;this option).
;   2) After each backup, remove all oars in the backup directory that are
;older than the specified number of days.
;    note: if the user set the bin directory as the backup location, only
;oar files are removed. There is no way to know if an oar was created by
;auto-backup, or manually created or uploaded. It is not recommended to use
;the bin directory for your auto backups for this reason.

[Textures]

; Chiefly, reuse occurs if a texture has already been generated with identical data and settings, and that texture contains no dynamic components
; (e.g. images pulled from an external HTTP address).
; Reusing previously generated textures results in a much faster update on the viewer but may cause issues if the viewer didn't receive all resolutions of the texture.
; Currently, it will also increase asset cache use since temporary dynamic textures are no longer deleted.
; Hence, currently considered experimental.
; Default is false.
ReuseDynamicTextures = true

; If true, then textures generated dynamically that have a low data size relative to their pixel size are not reused
; This is to workaround an apparent LL 3.3.4 and earlier viewer bug where such textures are not redisplayed properly when pulled from the viewer cache.
; Only set this to true if you are sure that all the viewers using your simulator will not suffer from this problem.
