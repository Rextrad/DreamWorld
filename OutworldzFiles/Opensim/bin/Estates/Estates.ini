; * This is an example estate config file.
; *
; * If a Region is loaded without an estate, OpenSimulator will ask you configuration questions to create or join an existing estate.
; * So there is no need to change this file directly, it is only for reference.
; * However, if you prefer you can also copy this file to Estates.ini and appropriately change the parameters below.
; * Only files ending with .ini and .xml in this directly will be loaded by OpenSimulator.
; *
; * You can add multiple estates into one file or make one file per estate
; * The section name is the estate name
; *
; *
; * Set in Dreamgrid's Smart Start Screen
